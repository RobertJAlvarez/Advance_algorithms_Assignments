# Advance algorithms Assignment 1

- The Fibonacci sequence can be defined by T(1) = 1, T(2) = 1 and
$$ T(n) = T(n−1) +T(n−2), n \ge 3 $$
Binet proposed a closed formula for the Fibonacci sequence:
B(n) = \frac{(\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2})^2 - (\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2})^n}{\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2} - \frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2}}

Show that Binet’s formula is correct, i.e. that
$$ B(n) = T(n) ∀n \ge 1 $$.
