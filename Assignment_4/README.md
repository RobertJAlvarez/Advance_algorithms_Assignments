# Assignment 4

1. Compile the given code found in archive `assignment4.tgz`, containing the
linked list implementations, the hashtables and the dictionary driver code. Run
the code on file `sp-en-dictionary.txt`. Observe the number of collisions.
Modify the code repeatedly to lower the size of the array used for the hashtable.
Run the code each time, observing the number of collisions. Draw a graph giving
the number of collisions (as a percentage of the number of entries) in function of
the size of the hashtable. Describe the graph and its overall behavior.

2. Compile the given code for a size of an array with 16 entries. Run the code on
the mini-dictionary `sp-en-mini.txt`. With the use of `gdb`, draw the graph
of pointers of objects created in memory for this dictionary.
